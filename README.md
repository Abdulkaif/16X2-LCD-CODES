# 16x2 LCD Codes

This repository contains code snippets and examples for interfacing with a 16x2 LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) using various microcontroller platforms. The code provides functionality to control the display and showcase different features of the LCD.


### Features

The code snippets in this repository demonstrate the following features and functionalities of the ```16x2 LCD``` display:


- Initializing the LCD module.
- Displaying text on the LCD.
- Scrolling text on the LCD.
- Creating custom characters on the LCD.
- Controlling the backlight of the LCD.
- Interfacing with the LCD using various microcontroller platforms.


### Getting Started

To get started with using the 16x2 LCD codes:

Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Abdulkaif/16X2-LCD-CODES.git```
Navigate to the file (display temperature on lcd.py, display_time_on_lcd.py, gpio_lcd.py(```'Contains function to connect 16X2 display with RaspberryPi when you are not having i2c on the 16X2 display. If you are having i2c connected to your 16X2 display then you can exclude this part of code.```), irsensor_display.py, lcd16X2.py, lcd_api.py(```lcd_api.py is required to use gpio_lcd.py. If you are having i2c connected to your 16X2 display then you can exclude this too along with the gpio_lcd.py ```)) you want for your RaspberryPi Pico microcontroller.
Open the example code file.
Connect the 16x2 LCD display to your microcontroller according to the provided pin connections in the code.
Upload and run the example code on your microcontroller.
Make sure to refer to the documentation and pinout diagrams specific to your microcontroller platform for proper connection and configuration.
